> Traffic management systems have primarily relied on live traffic sensors for real-time traffic guidance. However, this dependence often results in uneven service delivery due to the limited scope of sensor coverage or potential sensor failures. This research introduces a novel approach to overcome this limitation by synergistically integrating a Physics-Informed Neural Network-based Traffic State Estimator (PINN-TSE) with a powerful Natural Language Processing model, GPT-4. The purpose of this integration is to provide a seamless and personalized user experience, while ensuring accurate traffic density prediction even in areas with limited data availability. The innovative PINN-TSE model was developed and tested, demonstrating a promising level of precision with a Mean Absolute Error of less than four vehicles per mile in traffic density estimation. This performance underlines the model’s ability to provide dependable traffic information, even in regions where conventional traffic sensors may be sparsely distributed or data communication is likely to be interrupted. Furthermore, the incorporation of GPT-4 enhances user interactions by understanding and responding to inquiries in a manner akin to human conversation. This not only provides precise traffic updates but also interprets user intentions for a tailored experience. The results of this research showcase an AI-integrated traffic guidance system that outperforms traditional methods in terms of traffic estimation, personalization, and reliability. While the study primarily focuses on a single road segment, the methodology shows promising potential for expansion to network-level traffic guidance, offering even greater accuracy and usability. This paves the way for a smarter and more efficient approach to traffic management in the future.

## 引言 (I. INTRODUCTION)  
* *位置**：摘要後，頁面頂端開始  

> The escalating need for effective traffic management systems has become a matter of global urgency. As reported by the US Department of Transportation, more than 370,000 people lost their lives in transportation-related incidents over the last decade in the United States, with road incidents accounting for over 350,000 fatalities [1]. Globally, the issue extends beyond just safety; it is also an environmental concern. The World Bank in 2023 reports that the transportation sector contributes to a significant 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions [2]. Moreover, the safety of road users remains a pressing issue, with over 1.35 million lives claimed annually by road crashes, leading to serious injuries for an additional 50 million individuals [2]. In light of these statistics, the importance of accurate, real-time traffic predictions cannot be overstated. Current systems, despite their reliance on advanced monitoring technologies like surveillance cameras and GPS trackers, face considerable challenges in reliable traffic reading due to sensor failures and coverage scarcity [3]. Thus, the pursuit of a more robust and resilient traffic guidance system that can accurately predict traffic density even in the absence of real-time data is of paramount importance.

> This is where the potential of neural networks comes into play. These complex algorithms designed to mimic the human brain can learn from historical traffic data, distinguishing patterns that might be unnoticeable to human observers [4]. By learning from past traffic scenarios, the methods could provide insightful predictions, specifically when real-time traffic sensors are not operational. However, standard neural networks often lack the ability to incorporate physical laws [5]. Moreover, this models struggle to learn complex traffic dynamics unless they are provided with extensive amount of training data [6].

> On the other hand, the integration of language models with domain-specific machine learning models have witnessed a surge in the utilization across diverse domains. However, its potential remains largely uncharted territory, particularly in the context of traffic information dissemination [7], [8], [9].

> To address these challenges, our research aims to develop a physics-informed neural network (PINN) model for traffic prediction. This approach uses historic traffic data to predict traffic density based on factors such as the position on a highway and the time of day. To enhance the user experience, we integrate this model with a Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) API. GPT-4 serves as an interface between the user and the neural network model, interpreting the user’s traffic inquiries and providing real-time responses based on the model’s predictions. Thus, this novel approach combines the strengths of artificial intelligence and physics-based modeling, offering a potential solution to the current limitations of traffic management systems.

> The integration of PINN and a GPT-4 interface into traffic guidance systems has broad implications. In addition to improving traffic prediction accuracy, this approach could also enhance the user experience of real-time navigation systems and applications. Currently, these apps heavily rely on live GPS feeds to provide guidance, which can be compromised during sensor failures or unexpected road conditions [3]. Our proposed solution could offer a reliable backup system when such sensors fail for providing traffic information, significantly improving the systems’ reliability.

> This paper is organized as follows: Section II provides an overview of the previous works in similar research avenues. Section III details the methodology used in developing our model. Section IV presents the results, while Section V offers a comprehensive discussion of these results. Lastly, Section VI concludes the paper, highlighting the limitations of our study and providing recommendations for future research in this exciting field.

## 文獻綜述 (II. RELATED WORK)  
* *位置**：引言後  

> Traffic guidance systems are fundamental to modern transportation networks, serving as the backbone for managing and regulating traffic flow [10]. They include a wide range of methods, from static traffic signage to complex real-time traffic guidance systems, enhancing the road user experience and ensuring the smooth traffic flow. Real-time navigation apps like Google Maps and Waze are examples of such systems, leveraging GPS data to provide real-time traffic updates and optimized routing [3].

> A significant source of data for these real-time navigation apps are the extensive traffic sensor networks such as the GPS feeds from mobile devices. These sensors have become increasingly prevalent with the ubiquity of smartphones and in-vehicle GPS systems. The data from these sensors helps make traffic predictions more dynamic and accurate. By tracking the speed and location of a large number of vehicles, these systems can estimate current traffic conditions and even predict future congestion or delays [3].

> However, these methods have several limitations. Mainly, they are heavily dependent on the availability and accuracy of sensors’ data, requiring extensive sensor networks and constant data feeds. This dependency can pose challenges when there are data insufficiencies, such as in areas with low traffic sensor coverage or low smartphone penetration rates [11]. Furthermore, these systems can also falter in the case of sensor failures, potentially resulting in ineffective traffic management and exacerbating congestion. These limitations highlight the need for more robust and resilient traffic prediction methodologies capable of operating seamlessly within existing systems, even in case of inconsistent and intermittent traffic sensor data [12].

> Neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool in traffic management, offering the ability to process and analyze vast amounts of data, pattern recognition from historical data and improved prediction accuracy [13], [14]. Neural networks, mirroring the human brain’s structure, allow computers to learn from data, making them ideal for prediction and pattern recognition tasks [4], [15]. Yasdi, for instance, delves into the use of Recurrent Jordan networks, a specific type of neural network system, for forecasting short-term traffic flow based on time-series data [16]. This approach is echoed by More et.al, who apply Jordan sequential networks to predict future traffic volumes [17]. These networks, trained with real-time data, aim to optimize traffic flow and manage congestion. Building on this concept, Loumotis et.al proposed a novel system that blends the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict road traffic [18]. This system employs ANNs to estimate vehicle speed, thereby offering a congestion indicator.

> The exploration of neural networks in traffic prediction is further expanded by Abbas et.al. They investigate short-term traffic prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks [19]. With the objective of enhancing Intelligent Transport Systems’ proactive response abilities, their research introduces and juxtaposes three LSTM-based models, offering a comprehensive view of road traffic density prediction. This shows the increasing versatility and efficacy of neural networks in traffic prediction.

> However, traditional neural network models have limitations. While they can learn complex patterns from data, they often struggle with scenarios that involve complex physical dynamics or when data is insufficient to learn the physical pattern. This has led to the development of more sophisticated models, such as PINNs [6].

> PINNs integrate physical laws into model training, enhancing prediction accuracy and reliability [20]. Compared to traditional neural networks, PINNs offer advantages in scenarios with complex physical dynamics or insufficient data, as they leverage inherent physical principles to supplement data-driven learning [21]. The versatility of PINNs is evident in their applications across various scientific and computational domains. They have been employed as valuable tools in solving complex problems, from traffic state estimation, fluid dynamics and image reconstruction to material science and beyond [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27].

> In the context of traffic prediction, the integration of physical laws into PINNs can be particularly beneficial. For example, traffic flow follows certain physical laws such as the conservation of cars (analogous to the conservation of mass in fluid dynamics), which can be incorporated into the PINN model. This allows the model to make reasonable predictions even in the limited or absence of extensive traffic sensors, offering a potential solution to one of the main challenges faced by traditional traffic prediction methods. Accordingly, PINNs excel at ‘‘filling in the gaps’’ when data is incomplete, ensuring reliable traffic information [20]. Thus, this hybrid approach can potentially allow PINNs to overcome the limitations of traditional models, making them more robust in scenarios where data is sparse or noisy.

> Another main limitation with current traffic management systems is data accessibility and interpretation especially by non-technical users. Recently, Large Language Models (LLM) such as GPT-4 have been employed to act as a bridge between the user and the domain specific information [7], [8], [9], [28]. The integration of GPT-4 chat interfaces with domain specific data and models enhances user interaction and accessibility. Large language models such as GPT-4 acts as a bridge between the user and the domain specific information. This integration enhances the accessibility and usability of the domain knowledge, making it more approachable for everyday users [8], [9], [28]. On the other hand, it improves the user experience by providing personalized results based on the user’s specific inquiries [29], [30], [31].

> In summary, despite the considerable progress made in the field of traffic prediction, several research gaps persist. One notable gap is the lack of comprehensive models for predicting traffic density under varied conditions, crucial for traffic guidance systems [32], [33]. Many rely on traffic sensor data, posing significant limitations in scenarios where such sensors are unavailable or unreliable [34]. The current study aims to fill these gaps by developing a PINN model that predicts traffic density based on position and time data. By integrating this model with a user-friendly pre-trained GPT-4 interface, the study aims to provide a more accessible and reliable traffic prediction tool. This novel approach not only addresses the limitations of existing models but also expands AI’s potential in traffic prediction and management.

## 研究方法 (III. METHODOLOGY)  
* *位置**：文獻綜述後  

### A. 預處理 (Pre-processing)  
> The initial phase of our methodology is data preprocessing, an essential step that guarantees the validity and reliability of our traffic information system. This phase encompasses several primary procedures.  
> The first procedure is data cleaning, a method that ensures the data’s quality and accuracy. This is accomplished by detecting and correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the data, such as missing or duplicate entries.  
> Once the data is cleaned, we delineate the spatial and temporal resolution of the data. This involves classifying the data into distinct spatial and temporal bins, facilitating a breakdown of the data into more manageable segments for detailed analysis.  
> Subsequently, we compute the average traffic density and speed within each spatial and temporal bin. This process offers a comprehensive overview of the traffic conditions within each bin, enabling a more focused analysis.  
> The concluding procedure in the data preprocessing phase involves employing regression analysis to discover the relationship between traffic speed and density, as well as between traffic density and traffic flux. Regression analysis is a powerful tool in this context, helping us to discern the underlying patterns and trends in our traffic data. This understanding, in turn, assists us in defining the maximum and optimum traffic density for the road section, along with the free flow speed. These are the main parameters required to characterize the test road section traffic dynamics and are used in defining the traffic state equation. This enhances the predictive capacity of our system, ensuring it can provide accurate and trustworthy traffic forecasts.

### B. 物理信息神經網絡交通狀態估計器 (PINN-TSE)  
> The component of our traffic information system that estimates traffic patterns is constructed on a neural network model. This model is specifically engineered to leverage the processed data, learn traffic patterns, and check its estimations with the physical laws that govern traffic flow.  
> A detailed explanation of each segment of the full architecture of the PINN-TSE model, represented in Figure 1, is provided in the subsequent sections.

#### 1) 數據計算方面 (Data Computation Aspect)  
> In order to learn traffic patterns from the data, we employ a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). This type of neural network, known for its capacity to handle complex data patterns, incorporates an input layer, several hidden layers, and an output layer is used.  
> The input layer is designed to receive the processed independent variables input data, including position and time that determine the density and speed of the traffic. This data is then passed through the hidden layers, each consisting of a set number of neurons. These neurons apply various weights and biases to the data, and each layer’s output becomes the input for the next layer. The final layer, the output layer, provides the predicted traffic density.  
> The MLP incorporates nonlinear activation functions to better capture the complex relationship between the different inputs. Each layer’s number of neurons and the type of activation function used were determined through a series of experimental iterations to optimize the model’s performance.  
> The architecture of the neural network is crucial for the accurate prediction of traffic density, which serves as the foundation of our traffic information system. By fine-tuning the structure and hyper-parameters of the network, we were able to create a model that can effectively learn from the historic traffic data and make accurate predictions.

#### 2) 物理計算方面 (Physics Computation Aspect)  
> In addition to observed traffic pattern, our to traffic prediction leverages the power of physics-informed learning. By integrating physical laws into the neural network model, we ensure that our predictions adhere to real-world traffic behavior, enhancing the reliability and accuracy of our system.  
> The PINN uses the fundamental laws of traffic flow, mainly the conservation of vehicles, to guide its learning process.  
> In traffic flow theory, the conservation of vehicles states that the number of vehicles in a given section of roadway is equal to the number of vehicles that entered minus the number of vehicles that exited. Incorporating this law allows the neural network to better understand the relationship between traffic density and speed, leading to more accurate predictions.  
> To implement this, the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model is used. The LWR model is a macroscopic traffic flow model used in transportation engineering to describe the evolution of traffic density on a roadway. While the LWR model assumes that all drivers behave identically and that traffic conditions are homogeneous across lanes, which may not always be the case. Despite its limitations, the simplicity of the LWR model has significantly influenced the field of traffic flow theory and continues to be a key reference point for researchers and practitioners alike.  
> The LWR model is mathematically represented by a first-order, nonlinear partial differential equation, a conservation law that describes how the density of traffic evolves over time and space. The equation reflects the principle that the rate of change of vehicle density within any segment of road depends on the difference between the flow rates entering and exiting the segment. The basic form of the LWR PDE is:  
>  
> $$\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (\rho \cdot v(\rho)) = 0 \quad (1)$$  
>  
> Here, $\rho(x, t)$ represents the traffic density at position $x$ and time $t$, and $v(\rho)$ is the velocity of traffic, which is a function of density.  
> To simplify the relationship, Greenshield’s model that postulates a linear relationship between traffic density and speed, can be employed [35]. This relationship is expressed as:  
>  
> $$v = v_{max} \left(1 - \frac{\rho}{\rho_{max}}\right) \quad (2)$$  
>  
> where $v$ represents the space mean speed, $v_{max}$ is the maximum attainable speed, $\rho$ is the traffic density, and $\rho_{max}$ is the maximum traffic density.  
> By utilizing these relationships, we can substitute Greenshield’s equation into the LWR conservation law (equation 1) to solve it for traffic density, as presented here:  
>  
> $$\frac{\partial \rho(x, t)}{\partial t} + v_{max} \left(1 - 2\frac{\rho(x, t)}{\rho_{max}}\right) \frac{\partial \rho(x, t)}{\partial x} = 0 \quad (3)$$  
>  
> It’s worth noting that this equation is a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE), which poses certain challenges in finding strong solutions. To address this, a second-order diffusion term with user defined small numbers, $\epsilon$, can be introduced to the equation (equation 4), transforming the PDE into a parabolic form as in [27]. This modification helps ensure the existence of a strong solution and enhances our ability to study and model traffic flow dynamics accurately.  
>  
> $$\frac{\partial \rho(x, t)}{\partial t} + v_{max} \left(1 - 2\frac{\rho(x, t)}{\rho_{max}}\right) \frac{\partial \rho(x, t)}{\partial x} = \epsilon \frac{\partial^2 \rho(x, t)}{\partial x^2} \quad (4)$$  
>  
> By rearranging the terms, we can introduce a regularization factor, denoted as $R$, which serves to enforce compliance with the underlying physics of traffic flow:  
>  
> $$\frac{\partial \rho(x, t)}{\partial t} + v_{max} \left(1 - 2\frac{\rho(x, t)}{\rho_{max}}\right) \frac{\partial \rho(x, t)}{\partial x} - \epsilon \frac{\partial^2 \rho(x, t)}{\partial x^2} = R \quad (5)$$  
>  
> This regularization factor, $R$ in equation 5, plays a crucial role in ensuring that the neural network adheres to the principles governing traffic flow. Using $R$, we formulated a loss function that combines the data driven standard mean squared error and $R$, a physics-informed term. This term penalizes predictions that violate the conservation law, guiding the network to generate results that align with real-world traffic patterns. The weights and biases in the neural network are then updated using a gradient descent algorithm, balancing the need for accurate data fitting and adherence to physical laws.  
> The integration of physics-informed learning into the neural network architecture is a key feature of our approach, bridging the gap between data-driven machine learning models and physics-based traffic prediction.

### C. PINN-TSE 訓練 (Training)  
> As illustrated in Figure 1, the PINN-TSE training unfolds in two main steps:  
> 1) **Data-driven training**: During the first epoch, observed position and time data $(x_o, t_o)$ are input to the neural network to compute estimated traffic density $\hat{\rho}_o$ with randomly initialized parameters. The estimated density is compared against observed density $\rho_o$ via mean square error (MSE), forming the data-driven loss guiding the model to minimize prediction error.  
> 2) **Integration of physical laws**: In the second phase, collocation points $(x_c, t_c)$ are used to compute density $\hat{\rho}_c$ and solve the PDE to obtain the regularization factor $R$. Ideally, $R=0$ if the model fully complies with physical laws. The value of $R$ quantifies deviation from conservation law and is incorporated into the total loss to enforce physics adherence during training.

### D. 用戶互動與系統工作流程 (User Interaction and Streamlined System Workflow)  
> The system interprets user queries using Spacy NLP and regex to determine if queries are time-specific or general. Inputs are cleaned and formatted into time-location pairs. The PINN-TSE model predicts traffic density, which is then categorized into traffic states. Finally, GPT-4 generates user-friendly, contextually rich responses based on model outputs, ensuring seamless interaction.

### E. GPT-4 介面開發 (GPT-4 Interface Development)  
> GPT-4 acts as the communication bridge, interpreting user queries and generating responses. Implemented via Azure AI Studio API, prompt engineering is used to tailor GPT-4’s role as a traffic assistant for a 2100ft segment of I-80. The payload includes user query, PINN-TSE predictions, and traffic categorizations, enabling GPT-4 to produce precise, explanatory, and personalized answers.

### F. 系統驗證 (System Validation)  
> Validation includes PINN-TSE model performance testing via data partitioning and cross-validation, using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, live user interaction tests with GPT-4 assess the system’s ability to understand queries and generate tailored responses.
